Parse-Yapp-KeyValue version 0.02
================================

SYNOPSIS

How many times do we all run across a situation where we have some
data or could use some data that follows the form key=value?  HTTP
parameters, perhaps?  Maybe you need a configuration file for your
application and don't need the complexity and overhead of XML+XPath.
Perhaps you are searching for a very simple command-line parser for
your application and are burdened with the choices and complexity of
all the Getopt modules out there on CPAN.

Parse::Yapp::KeyValue has a simple interface and returns a reference
to a hash containing the key/value pairs it parses out of the input it
receives.  It correctly handles quoted strings by virtue of being a
LALR parser.  It handles multiple keys with the same name by promoting
that key's value to an array reference.

For more information on what Parse::Yapp::KeyValue can and cannot do,
please see the module's POD.
